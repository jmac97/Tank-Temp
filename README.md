# Tank-Temp

I wanted to make another version of my previous Aquarium Bot project due to the WiFi issues and also wanted a project to get comfortable with the STM32 microcontroller. I developed the system with an STM32 development board and created a "hat" that monitored the temperature, displayed the information on an OLED screen, and alerted my friend via an LED. Detailed description [here](https://www.juliesongmceldoon.com/tank-temp).
